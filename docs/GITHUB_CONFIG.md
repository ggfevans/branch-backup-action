### Reddit r/ObsidianMD
**Title:** `[Tool] Automated Weekly Backups for Git-Synced Vaults`

```markdown
I use Git to sync my Obsidian vault across devices, and wanted automated 
weekly snapshots as insurance. Created a GitHub Action that:

- Creates dated backup branches every Sunday
- Tags them with metadata (commits, contributors, files changed)  
- Alerts me if it fails
- No automatic cleanup (keeps everything)

Originally built for personal use, now sharing in case others find it useful.

GitHub: [link]

Provided as-is with limited support, but contributions/forks welcome!

**Use case:** Protection against accidental deletions, sync conflicts, 
major reorganizations, or plugin update issues.
```

## Community Guidelines

Consider adding a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:

```markdown
# Code of Conduct

This project is provided as-is as a personal tool shared with the community.

## Expected Behavior
- Be respectful in issues and discussions
- Provide constructive feedback
- Understand that support is limited
- Help other community members when possible

## Not Acceptable
- Demanding immediate support or features
- Hostile or aggressive communication
- Spam or off-topic content

## Enforcement
The maintainer reserves the right to close issues or discussions that 
don't follow these guidelines.

Remember: This is a personal project shared freely. Treat it as such.
```

## Contributing Guidelines (Already in README)

No separate CONTRIBUTING.md needed since it's covered in the README, but 
you could create one if you want to separate concerns.

## Repository Labels

Suggested labels for issues:

**Default GitHub labels are fine, but consider adding:**
- `obsidian-specific` - Issues specific to Obsidian use case
- `good-first-issue` - Easy contributions for newcomers
- `wontfix-by-maintainer` - Valid requests but outside scope
- `fork-encouraged` - Feature better suited for a fork

## Licensing

Already has MIT License file - no changes needed.

## Repository Visibility

Recommended: **Public**
- Allows community benefit
- Enable template feature
- Discoverable by others
- Can still be forked/modified

## Branch Protection (Optional)

Consider protecting `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews (optional, since it's personal)
- Require status checks (optional)

Or just use default - simpler for personal projects.

## Pinned Issues (Optional)

You could create and pin:
1. "Welcome & Introduction" issue
2. "Known Limitations" issue  
3. "Share Your Use Case" discussion

But this might be overkill for a simple tool.
